# rock-paper-scissors

This project is the first project in The Odin Project javascript foundations.
This is a normal rock paper scissors game mainly programmed in javascript, so the game is played in the console.

# how to play

#1 Open the console
#2 Type in your choice from rock, paper scissors. The input is case-insensitive, so any variations of upper and lower case is acceptable.
#3 Press ENTER or OK and see the result in the console.
#4 Repeat #2 and #3 for 4 more times. The game will automatically end and the result will be shown in the console.

I had easy time programming it since I had a competitive programming background in C++.
